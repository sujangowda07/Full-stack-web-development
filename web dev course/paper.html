             <img src="img/news.jpg.jfif" height="300"/>
             <p>Infosys, India’s second-largest technology outsourcing company, is urging its employees to return to the office at least three days a week, with plans to make this mandatory in the near future.<br>
                 The call for in-person attendance follows management's unsuccessful attempts to restore a regular office routine.</p>
             <p>Infosys cofounder NR Narayana Murthy has emphasized the importance of a 70-hour work week to boost productivity and economic growth, even as employees resist a return to the traditional office environment.</p>
             <p>ET in its report quoted an email from vertical heads of the Bengaluru-based software company which stated, “Please start coming to the office at least 3 days a week. It will become mandatory very shortly.” Infosys has not responded to requests for comment.</p>
