                <li> <p>The bit is the most basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. The name is a portmanteau of binary digit.</p></li>
                <li>
             <p>The bit represents a logical state with one of two possible values. These values are most commonly represented as either "1" or "0", but other representations such as true/false, yes/no, on/off, or +/− are also widely used.The relation between these values and the physical states of the underlying storage or device is a matter of convention, and different assignments may be used even within the same device or program. It may be physically implemented with a two-state device.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Examples:the uppercase "S" in the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) character set is assigned the decimal value of 83, which is equivalent to the binary value of 01010011. This figure shows the letter "S" byte and the corresponding place values.</li>

                <li>The "S" byte includes four 1 bits and four 0 bits. When added together, the place values associated with 1 bits total 83, which corresponds to the decimal value assigned to the ASCII uppercase "S" character. The place values associated with the 0 bits are not added into the byte total.</li>
                <li>Because a single byte supports only 256 unique characters, some character sets use multiple bytes per character. For example, Unicode Transformation Format character sets use between 1 and 4 bytes per character, depending on the specific character and character set. Despite these differences, however, all character sets rely on the convention of 8 bits per byte, with each bit in either a 1 or 0 state.</li>

                <li><h2>Array:</h2></li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), of same memory size, each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.[1][2][3] The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.</p>
                <li>For example, an array of ten 32-bit (4-byte) integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as ten words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ..., 2036, (in hexadecimal: 0x7D0, 0x7D4, 0x7D8, ..., 0x7F4) so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + (i × 4).[4] The memory address of the first element of an array is called first address, foundation address, or base address.
                </li>
                <li>Because the mathematical concept of a matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional grid, two-dimensional arrays are also sometimes called "matrices". In some cases the term "vector" is used in computing to refer to an array, although tuples rather than vectors are the more mathematically correct equivalent. Tables are often implemented in the form of arrays, especially lookup tables; the word "table" is sometimes used as a synonym of array.</li>
                <li>Arrays are among the oldest and most important data structures, and are used by almost every program. They are also used to implement many other data structures, such as lists and strings. They effectively exploit the addressing logic of computers. In most modern computers and many external storage devices, the memory is a one-dimensional array of words, whose indices are their addresses. Processors, especially vector processors, are often optimized for array operations.</li>
                <li>Arrays are useful mostly because the element indices can be computed at run time. Among other things, this feature allows a single iterative statement to process arbitrarily many elements of an array. For that reason, the elements of an array data structure are required to have the same size and should use the same data representation. The set of valid index tuples and the addresses of the elements (and hence the element addressing formula) are usually,[3][5] but not always,[2] fixed while the array is in use.</li>
