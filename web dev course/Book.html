        <h2>Method of preparation.</h2>
        <p>To prepare Hoskote Chicken Biryani, start by marinating 500g of chicken pieces in a mixture of 1/2 cup yogurt, 1 tablespoon each of ginger-garlic paste and lemon juice, 1 teaspoon red chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon garam masala, and salt to taste. Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 1-2 hours or overnight. Meanwhile, soak 2 cups of basmati rice for 30 minutes, then cook it with whole spices in salted water until 70-80% done. In a separate pan, heat 2-3 tablespoons of oil or ghee, sauté sliced onions until golden brown, and then add chopped tomatoes, green chilies, and 1 tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste. Cook until the tomatoes are soft, then add 2 teaspoons biryani masala powder, 1 teaspoon red chili powder, and 1 teaspoon garam masala. Cook the masala until the oil separates. Now, layer the partially cooked rice in an ovenproof dish, top it with the marinated chicken, fresh coriander, and mint leaves. Add the remaining rice as the top layer, and drizzle saffron-soaked milk, fried onions, and 2 tablespoons of ghee over it. Cover tightly and cook in dum (slow cooking) in a preheated oven at 350°F (180°C) or on low heat on the stovetop for 20-25 minutes. Once done, fluff the rice with a fork and garnish with additional fried onions, cashews, raisins, and fresh herbs if desired. Serve the aromatic Hoskote Chicken Biryani hot and enjoy!
